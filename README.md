Q-Design a scheduling program that is capable of scheduling many processes that comes in at  some time interval and are allocated the CPU not more that 10 time units. 
CPU must schedule processes having short execution time first. 
CPU is idle for 3 time units and does not entertain  any process prior this time. 
Scheduler must maintain a queue that keeps the order of execution of  all the processes. 
Compute average waiting and turnaround time. 

---This approach is based shortest job first. 
We will use C programming language to implement the above challenge. 
The purpose of using this algorithm is to compute the average waiting time and average turnaround time. 
Turnaround time – amount of time to execute a particular process. 
Waiting time – amount of time a process has been waiting in the ready queue.
